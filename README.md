# 🏏 IPL Player Performance & Auction Value Dashboard

An end-to-end data analytics project analyzing IPL player performance across 15 seasons (2008–2022) and benchmarking it against auction prices to identify **overpriced** and **undervalued** players.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

IPL auctions involve teams spending crores on players. This project builds a custom **Performance Score model** that combines batting and bowling stats, then compares it against actual auction prices paid to classify every auctioned player as:

- 🔴 **Overpriced** — high price, low performance
- 🟢 **Underpaid Gem** — low price, high performance
- 🟠 **Good Value** — reasonable price for output
- 🔵 **Fair Price** — market-rate purchase

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Microsoft Excel** | Data cleaning, null handling, column standardization |
**MySQL (Workbench)** | Database schema, SQL queries, performance aggregations |
**Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)** | EDA, feature engineering, normalization, visualizations |
**Tableau Public** | Interactive dashboard — 4 charts, filters, reference lines |

## 🔄 Project Workflow

```
Raw CSVs → Excel Cleaning → MySQL Database → Python EDA → Tableau Dashboard
```

### Phase 1 — Excel Cleaning
- Removed nulls and duplicate rows
- Standardized player names and team names
- Normalized `Season` column (handled `2020/21` format)
- Replaced `NA` string values in `Margin` and `Season` columns
- Saved clean files as UTF-8 CSV for MySQL import

### Phase 2 — SQL Database & Queries
- Created `ipl_analysis` database with 3 tables: `matches`, `ball_by_ball`, `auction`
- Imported data using `LOAD DATA INFILE` (225,954 rows in under 30 seconds)
- Wrote 6 analysis queries:
  - Top run scorers & wicket takers
  - Strike rate per batter (min 200 balls faced)
  - Economy rate per bowler (min 200 legal balls)
  - Average auction spend per team
  - Season-wise total and average runs
  - Performance Score vs Auction Value classification

### Phase 3 — Python EDA & Feature Engineering
- Loaded all 3 MySQL tables into Pandas via SQLAlchemy
- Calculated batting stats (runs, strike rate) filtering out wide deliveries
- Calculated bowling stats (wickets, economy rate) filtering out wides and no-balls
- Applied **Min-Max Normalization** to scale runs, strike rate and wickets to 0–100 range
- Engineered **Performance Score**:

```
Performance Score = (Runs_Norm × 0.4) + (Strike_Rate_Norm × 0.3) + (Wickets_Norm × 0.3)
```

- Classified 543 auctioned players into 4 value categories
- Generated 4 visualizations saved as PNG

### Phase 4 — Tableau Dashboard
- Built 4 interactive sheets connected to Python-exported CSVs
- Added average reference lines to scatter plot creating 4 value quadrants
- Published to Tableau Public

## 🧮 Performance Score Model

### Formula
```
Performance Score = (Runs_Normalized × 0.4) + (Strike_Rate_Normalized × 0.3) + (Wickets_Normalized × 0.3)
```

### Why these weights?
| Stat | Weight | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Runs | 0.4 | Batting output is the primary match-winning factor in T20 |
| Strike Rate | 0.3 | Scoring speed is critical in IPL — a slow 50 can hurt the team |
| Wickets | 0.3 | Wickets are valuable but bowlers are generally priced lower at auctions |

### Why normalization?
Raw runs (thousands) vs raw wickets (tens) are on completely different scales. Without normalization, the formula would always favor batters. Min-Max scaling brings all 3 stats to a 0–100 range before applying weights — making the comparison fair across all player roles.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Virat Kohli leads all-time run scorers** with 6,634 runs across 15 seasons, followed by Shikhar Dhawan (6,244) and David Warner (5,883)

2. **DJ Bravo is the all-time leading wicket taker** with 183 wickets, followed by SL Malinga (170) and YS Chahal (166)

3. **Kyle Jamieson & Benjamin Stokes were the most overpriced buys** — paid ₹15 Cr+ but had near-zero performance scores due to limited IPL appearances

4. **Shubman Gill was the biggest underpaid gem** — bought for just ₹1.8 Cr in 2018 but accumulated 1,900 runs with a 125 SR, long before becoming a superstar

5. **RCB spent the most overall** (₹270 Cr across 115 players) yet never won an IPL title — highest total spend, lowest return on investment

6. **Mumbai Indians were the smartest spenders** — lowest avg price paid (₹1.75 Cr) yet most IPL titles, proving smart retention > big auction splurges

7. **IPL scoring has trended upward** — avg runs per match rose from 309 in 2008 to 329 in 2022, reflecting the evolution of T20 batting

8. **2009 was the lowest-scoring season** (286.89 avg) — played in South Africa due to Indian elections, with slower pitches suppressing run rates

9. **2018 recorded the highest avg runs per match** (331.68) — peak of the aggressive T20 batting era

10. **39 out of 543 auctioned players (7.2%) were classified as Overpriced** — teams consistently overpay for overseas pace bowlers with limited IPL track records

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard

**Dashboard contains:**
- Top 10 IPL Run Scorers (2008–2022)
- Top 10 IPL Wicket Takers (2008–2022)
- Player Value Analysis — Price vs Performance scatter plot with quadrants
- Season-wise Scoring Trend (2008–2022)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Scope

- Auction data only covers 2013–2022; retained players (Kohli, Rohit) are excluded from value analysis since they bypass auctions
- Performance Score doesn't account for fielding, match impact, or captaincy value
- Future improvement: add phase-wise stats (powerplay vs death overs) and incorporate player age/fitness factors
- Could extend to predict fair auction value using regression models
